## Mobile Flashcards Project

This project is a mobile app for making flash cards to test themselves. Users have the ability to create new decks of cards for a subject they are studying. The user can then create a number of questions for that deck. Finally the user has the ability to take a quiz for a specific deck. The user can view the question/answer and select whether the got the question correct or incorrect. Once they have answered all questions they are shown a score of how they did. If a user hasn't completed a quiz in the current day they will receive a notification to complete one.
